Support Vector Machines Study

This study aims to classify the handwritten digits from 0-9. The train dataset has around 60K observations and test dataset has around 10K observations. Since the training 60K observations takes a lot of time, we will be using only 15% i.e. 9K observations for training data set. For predictions we will be using whole test dataset.

Since this dataset is almost cleaned up, we will directly go and train the model for predictions.

The codes have been written in R.
